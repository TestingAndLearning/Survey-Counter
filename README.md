# Survey-Counter
My first Java project. This project helped count up survey statistics faster. 

During a project, I needed to record a large number of survey results for the office. 
The procedure at the time was to use an Excel spreadsheet to add +1 for every answer in a row/column. 
This meant having to manually focus a cell, then press a hotkey to +1, then move to another cell and repeat. 

I made this program to remove a few unnecessary steps. 
All I have to do with this program is press the keys on the numpad to get results. 
Pressing each number added +1 to the corresponding question and automatically moved to the next cell. 
This resulted in more statistics being recorded per day. 

(Made in April 2014).
